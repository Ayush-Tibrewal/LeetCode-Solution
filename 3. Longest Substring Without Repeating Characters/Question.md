Given a string <code>s</code>, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

## Example 1:

<code>**Input:** s = "abcabcbb"

**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.</code>

## Example 2:

<code>**Input:** s = "bbbbb"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.</code>

## Example 3:

<code>**Input:** s = "pwwkew"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
subsequence and not a substring.</code>

## Constraints:

* <code>0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* <code>s</code> consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
