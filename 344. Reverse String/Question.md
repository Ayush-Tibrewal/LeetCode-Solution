# 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

## Example 1:

<code>Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]</code>

Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## Example 2:

<code>Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]</code>

Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

## Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s[i] is a printable ascii character.
